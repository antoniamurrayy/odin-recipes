                <ul>
                    <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
                    <li>1 small Onion <em>(finely diced)</em></li>
                    <li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder <em>(or 5 garlic cloves, finely minced)</em></li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon Pepper</li>
                    <li>32-40 ounce jar Marinara Sauce</li>
                    <li>Parmesan Ricotta Cheese Filling</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Add onion and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until meat begins to brown. Finish with garlic powder and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. Add more sauce if you prefer the lasagna to be extra saucy. Let the sauce continue to simmer.</li>
                    <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
                    <li>Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce. Place 3 noodles in single layers on top of the sauce. Coat each noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and top it off with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and meat sauce. Repeat and finish with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil. Continue baking, uncovered, for about 25 minutes longer, or until the cheese is bubbling. Cool lasagna for 10 minutes before serving or cutting slices.</li>
